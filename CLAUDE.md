# InkFirst

AI-generated study books for e-ink readers. Personal project by Aliaksei (aliaksei.kavaliou@kiloverse.com), may be open-sourced later. This file is the handoff context for Claude Code sessions — read it fully before doing anything.

## The idea (elevator pitch)

Chat AI is a bad container for learning: answers scroll away, there's no pacing, no structure, no way to go back and forth. InkFirst inverts this — the AI **compiles a book**, and the chat lives *around* the book instead of *being* the product.

The user says "I want to learn X, I have N minutes/day." The app (via Gemini API) generates a course outline, then chapters one at a time, in a pedagogical style the user picks from built-in presets at course-creation time. Presets ship in `:core` as named system-prompt templates:

- **headfirst-inspired** (default) — conversational, redundant on purpose, exercises every few pages, concrete-before-abstract. Inspired by the Head First pedagogy (do NOT use O'Reilly's "Head First" branding or trade dress; that's their IP).
- **textbook** — structured, formal, definition → example → practice.
- **practical** — minimal theory, code/hands-on heavy, project-oriented.

The chosen style key is stored in `course.json` and drives prompt selection for all generation calls. The user reads paginated chapters, selects text to ask the AI about it, takes notes (typed first, stylus handwriting later), and tracks progress chapter by chapter.

Name origin: "Ink First" = e-ink-first design + a nod to Head First. GitHub name checked as free in Aug 2026.

## Target device & constraints

- Primary device: **Onyx Boox Go 7 (black, 2025 gen)** — 7" e-ink, Android-based, stylus support, sideloaded APK.
- E-ink rules: **no animations, no scrolling** in reading UI. Paginated everything. High contrast, no gradients, generous tap targets. This is a feature, not a limitation — the book-page metaphor is the whole point.
- Standard Android app; Boox runs Android (Go 7: Android 12). Develop/test on emulator or any Android phone, verify on device via sideload.
- Onyx SDK (onyxsdk-pen 1.5.4) provides low-latency raw pen input. **Integrated and working**
  as of 2026-09-15, after three failed attempts — it is sparsely documented and several of its
  behaviours are counter-intuitive enough to have cost whole sessions. Read design.md §11 and
  `docs/onyx-pen-thread.md` before changing anything in `OnyxInkOverlay.kt`.

## Architecture decisions (already made — don't relitigate without asking)

1. **No backend.** Single Android app. Gemini API called directly from the device with the user's own API key (entered in settings, stored in Android Keystore/EncryptedSharedPreferences — never in files or git). BYO-key keeps costs zero and makes open-sourcing trivial.
2. **Local-first, plain files.** Courses live on disk as inspectable files: generated chapters as Markdown/HTML, outline + progress as JSON, ink strokes (later) in a simple custom JSON format. SQLite only for indexing/metadata if needed. Rationale: user's study material must be greppable, backupable, and readable in 10 years even if the app dies.
3. **Generation logic in its own Gradle module** (`:core` or similar), separate from UI. Not because a backend is planned (it isn't), but so the door stays open and the code stays testable.
4. **Stack: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose.** Native Android. No KMP, no Flutter (Flutter fights e-ink rendering).
5. **Figures are illustrations, not diagrams.** Phase 3 was originally specced as generated *diagrams*; that was reframed on 2026-09-10. The pictures exist to make a study page feel alive (the Head First trick), not to be reference material — so they're loose greyscale sketches from an image-capable Gemini model ("Nano Banana"), drawn per figure slot, with the house style in one constant in `:core`. A semantic diagram DSL rendered natively was designed and rejected: accurate, boring, and not what the pictures are for. See docs/design.md §7.
6. **Chapter generation is async**: request → outline/chapter generated → rendered → then read (possibly offline). Fits e-ink usage patterns; no need for streaming UI.

## Critical context: the user is NEW to Kotlin

Aliaksei's main language is PHP; Python is a language he likes but rarely uses; some frontend — **zero Kotlin experience**. Implications for every session:

- You write the Kotlin; explain non-obvious idioms briefly as you go (coroutines, sealed classes, null-safety, Compose recomposition). When an analogy helps, map from PHP (or web dev generally), not Python.
- Prefer boring, readable Kotlin over clever Kotlin.
- When a design choice involves a Kotlin/Android-ecosystem tradeoff the user can't be expected to evaluate yet, state your recommendation and the one-line reason; don't present unexplained option menus.
- Set up the project so `./gradlew` works from CLI — the user works in VS Code + Claude Code CLI, not necessarily Android Studio.

## MVP scope (build in this order)

1. **Project scaffold**: Android app + `:core` module, Gradle wrapper, min SDK ~26, target current. Runs on emulator.
2. **Course creation flow**: topic + daily minutes + prior-knowledge blurb → Gemini generates course outline (JSON: chapters, objectives, estimated time each).
3. **Chapter generation**: generate chapter N from outline + running course memory (see design.md — cross-chapter memory is the interesting problem). Output: structured Markdown with exercise blocks.
4. **Reading view**: paginated (page-turn taps, no scroll), renders chapter Markdown. This is the heart of the app — get typography right for e-ink.
5. **Selection-anchored chat**: select text → side panel/overlay chat with Gemini; prompt includes selection + chapter + course context. Q&A saved per-chapter.
6. **Progress tracking**: chapter done/in-progress, simple course dashboard.
7. Typed notes per chapter.

**Explicitly NOT in MVP**: handwriting/stylus (phase 2, via Onyx pen SDK — *since built, see
design.md §11*), other platforms (iPad was discussed and deliberately deferred; not a goal),
accounts/sync/backend (never, unless this becomes a product).

## Working agreements

- Gemini model choice: default to a Flash-tier model for generation (cheap, fast); make the model name a settings constant, not hardcoded everywhere.
- Never commit API keys; `.gitignore` from the first commit.
- Keep `docs/design.md` updated when architecture actually changes; keep this file updated when *decisions* change.
- Dogfooding is the success metric: "Aliaksei reads a generated chapter on the Boox in the evening" beats any feature. Bias toward getting the read-loop working end-to-end early, even ugly.

## Where things stand (2026-09-15)

The app is **built and in daily use on the Boox Go 7**. MVP items 1–7 all ship; several
post-MVP slices ship on top. Treat the list below as the current truth — the "nothing built
yet" note that used to live here was two months stale.

- [x] MVP 1–7: scaffold, course creation, chapter generation with cross-chapter memory,
      paginated reader, selection-anchored chat, progress tracking, notes.
- [x] **Phase 3 figures** — hand-drawn chapter illustrations, device-verified (see design.md §7).
- [x] **Badges** — a per-course mascot marking exercise / recap / answer / code blocks (§9).
- [x] **Chapter covers** — an opening picture of the problem each chapter solves (§10).
- [x] **Phase 2 handwriting** — the Onyx raw-ink path works: drawing with no lag, stroke
      persistence, tap-on-stroke chip, delete, page navigation (§11).
- [x] **Erase by sweep** — device-verified 2026-09-17, along with a long chain of panel
      fixes found while testing it: the Onyx driver keeps its own ink layer below Android's
      framebuffer, and EPD repaints had been aimed at the transparent ink SurfaceView rather
      than the view actually showing the page. Read `docs/onyx-pen-thread.md` §T7 before
      touching anything about repainting, ghosting, or tap handling — it is the session log
      and it records what was measured rather than assumed.
- [x] **Selection precision** — a pen mark now selects what it points at: whole words with
      clipped ends kept only if half-covered, an underline marking exactly one line (this was
      the "Ask AI returns the line below" defect), a circle marking the line it encloses, and
      strokes anchoring by their middle rather than by wherever the pen landed. A margin bar
      is a passage-marking gesture that reads across blocks, and asking leaves a `?` marker
      in the margin so a question is visible on the page.
- [x] **Reader signals (§13)** — `reader.md` per course records how each chapter was READ
      (questions asked and the passages they were asked about, passages marked without a
      question, notes written), and feeds forward into the next chapter's prompt under
      explicit bounds. Assembled from stored data, so no API call and covered by unit tests.
      Not yet surfaced in the UI: the file is inspectable at
      `<courses-root>/<slug>/reader.md` and is meant to be editable by hand.
- [ ] Known open defects: first line of a page not drawable. See `docs/onyx-pen-thread.md` §T7.
- [ ] **Two tap detectors, unconsolidated.** One finger contact is handled both by the
      reader's own `awaitEachGesture` and by the overlay (which must report taps itself,
      since the SDK owns the host view's touch stream). Three separate bugs on 2026-09-17
      came from the two drifting apart. The fix is one detector with an explicit ladder:
      menu open → close · chip open → dismiss · hits a stroke → chip · footer → menu ·
      else → zone turn.

**Device tip that paid for itself:** `adb exec-out screencap -p` is a differential test on
the Boox, not just a screenshot. It captures Android's framebuffer, which the pen driver
bypasses — so an artefact visible in the capture is real app state, and one visible on the
glass but absent from the capture is driver ink or EPD residue. That distinction resolved
several "ghost" reports in minutes.

See `docs/design.md` for data model, file formats, and the generation strategy.
